## Datastructure and algorithm

### Datastructure

- Array
- Linked List
- Double linked list
- Heap
```
- array based datastructure parent greater than its children
- construct: 
    + top down: add new element to array and up heap
    + bottom up: recursive to build sub heap and then join 2 heap by a node 
      and then down heap bubbling
- heap sort: 
    + in place heap sort: build heap in place and repeat swap the root to 
      the last element then down heap bubbling
```

- Binary tree
- Binary search tree
- Trie
- AVL Tree
- Stack
- Queue
- 2 Ended queue
- Graph
- Hashtable

#### sample question

- `Please build a data structure to cache results from SQL query `
- Binary tree traversal, inorder, iterative

### Algorithms `( time complexity for each )`
- insertion sort
- selection sort
- quick sort
- merge sort
- heap sort
- Time and Space Complexity analysis

#### sample question

```
 Step to do: 
    1. Clarify the requirements
    2. Do some sample 
    3. Suggest some solution from naive to optimal
    4. Analyze the pros, cons and complexity of each one
    5. Choose one algorithm
    6. Code
    7. Run by your self
    8. Find the way to improve performance
```

- Find k th most occured character
- Find square root of number without built in function.
- Implement linked list. Delete node with O(1).
- reverse a linked list
- verify a binary search tree
- given a list of number, find the first K minimum number

## Operating system
- [ ] `process`
- [ ] `thread`
- [ ] `schedule process ( mutex, semaphore)`
- [ ] schedule thread
- [ ] context switch
- [ ] file system
- [ ] `virtual memory`
- [ ] `Little and big endian`

## Networking

- [ ] how the intenet work

### IP - internet protocol

- [ ] how IP work

### TCP
- [ ] `how TCP work`
- [ ] `structure of headers`
- [ ] `properties of connections (*)`
- [ ] `TCP handshake`
- [ ] TCP proxy
- [ ] `terminate connections`
- [ ] `TCP congestion control`

### UDP
- [ ] how UDP work 

### HTTP

## Web security

- [ ] how https works
- [ ] how to defend DDOS
- [ ] `cryptography`
- [ ] ` how to store password `
```
Never store raw password, store hashed instead and use Bcrypt instead of md5 and careful about SQL injection
```

### HTTPS

## Database

### SQL

- [Order of execution in SQL query](https://www.sisense.com/blog/sql-query-order-of-operations/)
- LEFT JOIN
- RIGHT JOIN
- INNER JOIN
- CASE WHEN
- `Complexity of SQL query`

### Concept
- [ ] Describe database master slave process
- [ ] ACID
- [ ] first, second, third nomalization
- [ ] explain how index in Database work
- [ ] partitions database
- [ ] shared lock/exclusive lock
- [ ] isolation
- [ ] dirty/non-repeatable reads
- [ ] `composite index and how they was implemented`

## Behavieral
- [ ] `talk about your career ( who do you want to be in the next 5 years at shopee ? )`
- [ ] Why do you choose shopee?
- [ ] Tell me the reason you leave your previous company
- [ ] your expectation to work in shopee
- [ ] tell me about project you learn the most
