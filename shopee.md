## Datastructure and algorithm

### Datastructure

- Array
- Linked List
- Double linked list
- Heap
```
- array based datastructure parent greater than its children
- construct: 
    + top down: add new element to array and up heap
    + bottom up: recursive to build sub heap and then join 2 heap by a node and then down heap bubbling
- heap sort: 
    + in place heap sort: build heap in place and repeat swap the root to the last element then down heap bubbling
```

- Binary tree
- Binary search tree
- Trie
- AVL Tree
- Stack
- Queue
- 2 Ended queue
- Graph
- Hashtable
